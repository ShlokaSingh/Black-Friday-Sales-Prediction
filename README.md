## 🧠 Problem Overview

A retail company “ABC Private Limited” wants to understand the customer purchase behavior 
(specifically, purchase amount) against various products of different categories. 
They have shared a purchase summary of various customers for selected high volume products from last month. 
The data set also contains customer demographics (age, gender, marital status, city_type, stay_in_current_city),
product details (product_id and product category) and Total purchase_amount from last month. Now, they want to build a model to predict the purchase amount of customers against various products which will help them to create a personalized offers for customers against different products.

📌 The objective is to **predict purchase amount** using supervised learning.
